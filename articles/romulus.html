    <h1>Who was Romulus, and did he even exist?</h1>
    <p>Schoolkids around the world learn about Romulus, breastfed with milk by a wolf together with his twin brother Remus.</p>
    <p>He founded Rome and thus became its first King. Along the way he killed his brother, invited crooks and other shady types to his new city, and kidnapped women to secure the long-term viabiluty of his upstart city.</p>
    
    <p>So goes the legend, anyway. But is any of it true? Did he even exist?</p>
    <p>The truth is that we don't know. If you ask modern historians, most would say that Romulus, 
        which basically means "Mr Rome", did not exist, and that he was gradually invented by later Romans
        to explain the city's establishment.</p>
    <p>What we do know is that this became the mainstream story that Romans told themselves. 
        We also know that some Romans were uneasy about the exagerrated (and unsavory) nature of some aspacts of this founding story.</p>
    <p>What seems most likely, many historians are speculating (because they really don't know) is that 
        Rome existed as a settlement before Romulus, and - like most cities - gradually emerged and, at some point, got the name Rome. 
    <p>Then, eventually, it seems that a few Etruscans indeed did rule the city. Etruria was after all the dominant force in the region, 
        even though far from centralised. Calling these leaders 'Kings' seems to be a stretch, however, since this evokes
        our more modern (and originally Medieval) notion of a supreme Monarch. That seems unlikely in Early Rome, which after 
        all was a fairly small town. </p>
