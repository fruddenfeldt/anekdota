    <h1>Myth vs Reality</h1>
    <p>Roman history, as told by Roman historians at the time, claims that the Republic
        was thrust unto the world stage through a quick succession of dramatic and heroic events.</p>
    <p>The tyrannical King was deposed and a rational rule by elected Consuls. Rationality and good sense had prevailed.
