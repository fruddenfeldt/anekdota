        <p>No one knows how Rome came about.</p>
        <p>There are legends, there are theories about those legends. There are also archeological finds, and theories about those finds.</p>
        <p>There is no firm evidence for any of those.</p>
        <p>The legends, however, were what the Romas told themselves about their origins. This itself makes them interesting.</p>
        <p>The strangest thing about these legends is how unflattering they are. To take a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remulus killed his brother in what seems like an unecessary act of rage.</li>
                <li>Early Rome lacked women so they abducted them from neighboring towns.</li>
                <li>Several of the later, but still legendary, Kings were not from Rome but Etruria</li>
                <li>Ex-slaves were common among senior leaders</li>
            
            </ul>
