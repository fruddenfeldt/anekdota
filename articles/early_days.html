    <p>The rise of Rome is still a mystery.</p>

<p>It was a mystery even to the Romans themselves. Rome lasted for a very long time, and the written record was very scant, but Romans needed a story on how they came about.</p>

        
        
        <p>There are legends, there are theories about those legends. There are also archeological finds, and theories about those finds.</p>
        <p>There is no firm evidence for any of those.</p>
        <p>The legends, however, were what the Romas told themselves about their origins. This itself makes them interesting.</p>
        <p>The strangest thing about these legends is how unflattering they are. To take a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remulus killed his brother in what seems like an unecessary act of rage.</li>
                <li>Early Rome lacked women so they abducted them from neighboring towns.</li>
                <li>Several of the later, but still legendary, Kings were not from Rome but Etruria</li>
                <li>Ex-slaves were common among senior leaders</li>
            
            </ul>

        <p>What can we take away from this period when looking at Rome's later (and more well-documented) history?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social mobility was an accepted contept from the beginning</li>
            <li>Using violence to get a high position was common early on</li>
            <li>Seeking to become 'King' become a strong political taboo.</li>
        </ul>
