            <p>After Romulus came Numa, the second King of Rome. If Romulus was the warrior-leader, Numa was the pacifist-priest.</p>
            <p>According to the legend, Numa, or Numa Pomilius, is credited with creating many of Rome's most important religious instituions, including the office of the Pontifex Maximus.</p>
            <p>He also managed to keep Rome out of war. The temple of Juno (?), built during his reign, had its doors shut his whole reign, which never happened again.</p>
