    <h1>Republican myths</h1>
        <p>Great stories tend to survive, however false they may be. The same goes for the story of the founding of the Roman Republic. It is a story that has everything. 
            It has violence, sex, drama, heroism, selfishness and selflessness, and much more. It is no wonder, then, that the Romans liked to tell this story about themselves.
