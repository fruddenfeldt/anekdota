        <p>Around 300 before Christ, Rome was invaded by a Gaulish tribe.</p>
        <p>After this, Rome would not be invaded by a foreign force for another 800 (?) years - a remarkable feat in ancient history, or perhaps any history.</p>
        <p>At the time of the invasion, Rome was still not the empire that we think of today. It was a powerful but not yet dominant regional force; Rome didn't even control all of Italy. The city had, however, forged strong alliances across Northern Italy.</p>
        <p>The invaders were Gaulish (spelling?) and led by Brennan (?)</p>
