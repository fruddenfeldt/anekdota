        <h1 class="articleH1">Emperor Commodus</h1>
        <p>Rome had hundreds of emperors, and among these, Commodus is considered among the very worst</p>
        
        <p>There were few other truly terrible emperors, and we'll get to them soon enough,
            but what makes Commodus interesting is how great is father was. His father was Marcus Aurelius, the great 'philospher-emperor' and stoicist and author of 'Meditations'</p>
        
        
        <p>Aurelius was the last in a chain of successful emperors who had inherited the 'purple' from their adoptive fathers.
            Since none of them had biological sons they adopted capable sons. This led to a sort of meritocracy.
        </p>
        
        <p>Marcus Aurelius, though, had a son, and passed the reign to him.</p>
        
            <p>So, what was so terrible about Commodus?</p>
        
        <p>First and foremost, he was cruel. Very cruel.</p>
        
        <p>He was also sweet, in his own cruel way. You see, he wanted to be a gladiator. He loved the big stage.
            And there was nothing Romans despised more than actors. They ranked lower on the social ladder than slaves and prostitutes.
